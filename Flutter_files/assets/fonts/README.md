# Font Files Needed

To complete the font change, you need to download the Open Sans font files and place them in this directory.

Download the following files from https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans:
- OpenSans-Regular.ttf
- OpenSans-Bold.ttf
- OpenSans-Italic.ttf

Place these files in this directory (assets/fonts/) and then run:
```
flutter pub get
```

Alternatively, if you prefer a different font, you can:
1. Download your preferred font files (.ttf or .otf)
2. Place them in this directory
3. Update the pubspec.yaml file to reference your chosen font family and files
4. Update the fontFamily in main.dart to match your chosen font
